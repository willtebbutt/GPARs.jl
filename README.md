GPARs.jl is a rudimentary implementation of the Gaussian Process Autoregressive Regressor (GPAR), introduced in [our AISTATS paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/requeima19a.html). See CITATION.bib for an appropriate bibtex citation.

We also maintain a [Python version of this package](https://github.com/wesselb/gpar) -- this is much more fully featured, and we recommend that you use this implementation if you require the full collection of techniques introduced in that paper.
